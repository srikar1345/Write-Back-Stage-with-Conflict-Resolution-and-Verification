# Write-Back-Stage-with-Conflict-Resolution-and-Verification
This repository contains the design, implementation, and formal verification of a high-integrity Write-Back (WB) Stage for a RISC-V processor. The project focuses on resolving architectural conflicts between multiple write sources (ALU, Data Memory, and PC+4) optimized logic and model checking using NuSMV.
